RULES ARE BELOW

1. Understanding what you need to know
2. Why we need this information
3. Where and how to contact us
4. How to delete your info from our game


1. Understand all the rules
You can play and have fun in this game. Meeting up with friends and jumping around from tree to tree!
You can play with strangers and really just anyone you want to play with.
When ever joining and playing the game you are allowing us to see your IP address (go to 2 to understand more about why we need this) this just makes it so much easier to make sure everyone feels safe by banned any bad people breaking the rules.
If you do not feel safe with us having this information you can contact us (go to 3 for the gmail) and we will delete your playfab account. But
upon having your playfab account removed you wont be able to play again without Playfab making you another account. You may never be able to play the game again after getting your account deleted.
If you are caught being rude or just not following rule at all then you will be banned. The ban length is up to me you will not be able to how long you are banned for.


2. Why we need this info
We need this info to be able to ban people that are causing havoc, drama, or just being a bad person.
We (the devs of the game) do not tend to use any info that we get from Playfab at all.
This info allows us to prevent people being bullied, harassed, and assaulted. If anyone is caught doing so then they are banned. (I will choose the length depending on how much they did it.)
If any of our devs are caught using this info for their own advantage they will be perma banned from the game and banned from any socials involving the game.

3. Where and how to contact us
You can contact us on discord or gmail. The links will be given shortly. After I tell you why you may need to contact us.
You may need to contact us to delete your account. (go to 4 to understand better).
another reason could be because someone on the team may have falsely banned you. (please contact us if this happens we will un do it right away!!!)
Here are the links: Discord: https://discord.gg/6x8kg8D5Hy     The Gmail account: monkeyshomeofficial@gmail.com 
If you need to contact us at any time the links will always be here.


4. How to delete your account safely
You can contact the Gmail account given above to ask me to delete your account. It is not always guarenteed that I will answer within a few days.
Whenever your account is deleted you most likely won't be able to play the game again with Playfab automatically making you another account. If you want to play again then you will have to accept that it will make a new account which gives us access to your IP address.


5. The End
I hope this clears everything up for anyone wondering about anything. If you would like to tell me about anything contact my gmail monkeyshomeofficial@gmail.com see everyone later bye!! ----- Monkeys Home
